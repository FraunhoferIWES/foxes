    "For some applications it may be useful to run `foxes` in state-by-state mode, i.e., without the benefits of state-wise chunking. For example, when coupling it to another simulation tool that runs based on an overall outer loop over the individual states.\n",
    "\n",
    "For such cases the `Sequential` algorithm has been added, which basically is an iterator over the states. Obviously this algorithm is much slower than the `Downwind` or the `Iterative` algorithms. On the plus side, for timeseries ambient states, it has the advantage that it can easily be combined with local propagation of wake parcels between two subsequent time stamps. This functionality is provided by the wake frame class `SeqDynamicWakes` and does not require horizontal homogeneity. \n",

    "The wake result is the same as for the `DynamicWakes` wake frame, cf. a previous example, but now it has been computed in the context of state-by-state evaluation."
