    "- Take the time to think about your engine choice, and its parameters. Your choice might matter a lot for the performance of your run.\n",
    "- In general, all engines accept the parameters `n_procs`, `chunk_size_states`, `chunk_size_points` (the `single` engine ignores them, though).\n",
    "- If `n_procs` is not set, the maximal number of processes is applied, according to `os.cpu_count()` for Python version < 3.13 and `os.process_cpu_count()` for Python version >= 3.13.\n",
    "- If `chunk_size_states` is not set, the number of states is divided by `n_procs`. This might be non-optimal for small cases.\n",
    "- If `chunk_size_points` is not set and there is more than one states chunk, the full number of points is selected such that there is only one point chunk for each state chunk. If there is only one states chunk, the default points chunk size is the number of points divided by `n_procs`.\n",
    "- In general, for not too small cases, the default `process` engine is a good choice for runs on a linux based laptop or a workstation computer, or within Windows WSL.\n",
    "- For runs on native Windows, i.e., without WSL, the best engine choices have not been tested. Make sure you try different ones, e.g. `process`, `multiprocess`, `dask`, `numpy`, `ray`, and also vary the parameters.\n",
    "- The `mpi` engine requires the installation of MPI on the system, for example _OpenMPI_. Don't forget to run this as for example for 12 cores by `mpiexec -n 12 python -m mpi4py.futures run.py`, with `engine = foxes.Engine.new(\"mpi\", n_procs=12, ...)`.\n",
    "- If you run into memory problems, the best options are to either reduce the number of processes or the chunk sizes.\n",
    "- The `dask` engine has additional options, accessible through the _dask\\_pars_ dictionary parameter, for example the _scheduler_ choice. See API and [dask documentation](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/scheduling.html) for syntax and more info.\n",
    "- The `local_cluster` is not always faster than the `process`, `multiprocess` or `dask` engines, but offers a more detailed setup. For example, the memory and the number of threads per worker can be modified, if needed.\n",
    "- The `numpy` and `single` engines are intended for testing and small cases, and also for sequential runs without large point evaluations, or for smallish runs with wake frame `dyn_wakes`."
