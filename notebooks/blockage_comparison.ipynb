    "In the above plot the four different induction models are shown. The SelfSimilar, SelfSimilar2020 and Rathmann models are all based on a combination of a radial and axial shape function. The axial shape functions are derived from the solution to a rotating semi-infinite vortex cylinder along the centreline. The functions define the blockage effect in front of the rotor only, hence to give a more realistic flow effect behind the rotor, speed up behind and to the sides of the rotor is shown by mirroring the blockage in the rotor plane with the opposite sign. The area directly behind has no wake effect because this example uses no deficit model for the wake behind the turbine.\n",
