    "This example demonstrates some basics about running wind farm optimization tasks with `foxes`. All optimizations use the [iwopy](https://github.com/FraunhoferIWES/iwopy) interface in the background (also by Fraunhofer IWES, see link for details). Let's first make sure this and other required packages are installed, as a standard user by \n",

The second line installs the optimization library [pymoo](https://pymoo.org/) which contains a number of very nice genetic algorithm implementations.
