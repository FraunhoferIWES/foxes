.. versionadded:: 1.5
    New ambient states classes :ref:`DatasetStates<foxes.input.states.DatasetStates>`, 
    :ref:`PointCloudData<foxes.input.states.PointCloudData>`, 
    :ref:`WeibullField<foxes.input.states.WeibullField>`, 
    :ref:`WeibullPointCloud<foxes.input.states.WeibullPointCloud>`; 
    new turbine type :ref:`CalculatorType<foxes.models.turbine_types.CalculatorType>`; new rotor model 
    :ref:`DirectMDataInfusion<foxes.models.rotor_models.DirectMDataInfusion>`

.. versionchanged:: 1.5
    Important bug fix for turbine model :ref:`SetFarmVars<foxes.models.turbine_models.SetFarmVars>` that messed up the turbine ordering.
    Similar fix for all turbine models with flag `pre_rotor` set to `True`. 

.. versionadded:: 1.4
    This version introduces `WakeDeflection` models. This replaces and generalizes the `YawedWakes` wake frame of previous versions. 
    Now any choice of wake frame can be combined with yawed wakes, for example streamlines or dynamic wakes, see :ref:`Dynamic wake deflection`.
    The wake deflection model is selected through the parameter `wake_deflection` or the algorithm and then applies to all wakes.

.. versionadded:: 1.4
    The `Jimenez` wake deflection model, which optionally rotates the waked wind vector along the bent wake path.

*Farm Optimization and eXtended yield Evaluation Software*

*FOXES* is a modular wind farm and wake modelling code written in Python 
by Fraunhofer IWES. It has many applications, for example

* Wind farm optimization, e.g. layout optimization or wake steering,
* Wind farm post-construction analysis,
* Wake model studies, comparison and validation,
* Wind farm simulations invoking complex model chains.

The fast performance of *foxes* is owed to vectorization and parallelization,
and it is intended to be used for large wind farms and large timeseries inflow data.
The parallelization on local or remote clusters is supported, based on 
`mpi4py <https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ or
`dask.distributed <https://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/>`_.
The wind farm
optimization capabilities invoke the `foxes-opt <https://github.com/FraunhoferIWES/foxes-opt>`_
package which as well supports vectorization and parallelization.
