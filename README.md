# Welcome to foxes

## Overview

The software `foxes` is a modular wind farm simulation and wake modelling toolbox which is based on engineering wake models. It has many applications, for example

- Wind farm optimization, e.g. layout optimization or wake steering,
- Wind farm post-construction analysis,
- Wake model studies, comparison and validation,
- Wind farm simulations invoking complex model chains.

The calculation is fully vectorized and its fast performance is owed to [dask](https://www.dask.org/). Also the parallelization on local or remote clusters is enabled via `dask`. The wind farm
optimization capabilities invoke the [iwopy](https://github.com/FraunhoferIWES/iwopy) package which
as well supports vectorization.

`foxes` is build upon many years of experience with wake model code development at IWES, starting with the C++ based in-house code _flapFOAM_ (2011-2019) and the Python based direct predecessor _flappy_ (2019-2022).

## Requirements

The supported Python versions are: 

- `Python 3.7`
- `Python 3.8`
- `Python 3.9`
- `Python 3.10`
- `Python 3.11`

## Installation via pip

### Virtual Python environment

First create a new `venv` environment, for example called `foxes` and located at `~/venv/foxes` (choose any other convenient name and location in your file system if you prefer), by

```console
python3 -m venv ~/venv/foxes
```

Then activate the environment every time you work with `foxes`, by

```console
source ~/venv/foxes/bin/activate
```

You can leave the environment by

```console
deactivate
```

The `pip` installation commands below should be executed within the active `foxes` environment.

### Standard users

As a standard user, you can install the latest release via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/foxes/) by

```console
pip install foxes
```

This commands installs the version that correspond to the `main` branch at [github](https://github.com/FraunhoferIWES/foxes). Alternatively, you can decide to install the latest pre-release developments (non-stable) by

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/FraunhoferIWES/foxes@dev#egg=foxes
```

### Developers

For developers using `pip`, simply invoke the `-e` flag in the installation command in your local clone:

```console
git clone https://github.com/FraunhoferIWES/foxes.git
cd foxes
pip install -e .
```
The last line makes sure that all your code changes are included whenever importing `foxes`. Concerning the `git clone` line, we actually recommend that you fork `foxes` on GitHub and then replace that command by cloning your fork instead.

## Installation via conda

### Preparation

It is strongly recommend to use the `libmamba` dependency solver instead of the default solver. Install it once by

```console
conda install conda-libmamba-solver -n base -c conda-forge
```

We recommend that you set this to be your default solver, by

```console
conda config --set solver libmamba
```

### Virtual Python environment

First create a new `conda` environment, for example called `foxes`, by

```console
conda create -n foxes -c conda-forge
```

Then activate the environment every time you work with `foxes`, by

```console
conda activate foxes
```

You can leave the environment by

```console
conda deactivate
```

The `conda` installation commands below should be executed within the active `foxes` environment.

### Standard users

The `foxes` package is available on the channel [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/foxes). You can install the latest version by

```console
conda install foxes -c conda-forge --solver=libmamba
```

The `--solver=libmamba` is optional. Note that it is not necessary if you have set the `libmamba` solver as your default, see above.

### Developers

For developers using `conda`, we recommend first installing foxes as described above, then removing only the `foxes` package while keeping the dependencies, and then adding `foxes` again from a git using `conda develop`:

```console
conda install foxes conda-build -c conda-forge --solver=libmamba
conda remove foxes --force
git clone https://github.com/FraunhoferIWES/foxes.git
cd foxes
conda develop .
```

The last line makes sure that all your code changes are included whenever importing `foxes`. The `--solver=libmamba` is optional. Note that it is not necessary if you have set the `libmamba` solver as your default, see above.

Concerning the `git clone` line, we actually recommend that you fork `foxes` on GitHub and then replace that command by cloning your fork instead.

## Usage

For detailed examples of how to run _foxes_, check the `examples` and `notebooks` folders in this repository. A minimal running example is the following, based on provided static `csv` data files:

```python
import foxes

states = foxes.input.states.Timeseries("timeseries_3000.csv.gz", ["WS", "WD","TI","RHO"])

mbook = foxes.ModelBook()

farm = foxes.WindFarm()
foxes.input.farm_layout.add_from_file(farm, "test_farm_67.csv", turbine_models=["NREL5MW"])

algo = foxes.algorithms.Downwind(mbook, farm, states, ["Jensen_linear_k007"])
farm_results = algo.calc_farm()

print(farm_results)
```

## Contributing

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am "your awesome message"`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin new_branch`)
